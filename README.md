## About 
 In this project we provide a intuitional user inerface that allows the user to keep track of their budget.  The user will be able to add and subtract money from their current budget.  Then the program will display the user's budget over time using a chart.

## Usage 
 In order to use this project as a user, you will go to the [deployed project](https://warm-dawn-06348.herokuapp.com/).  When there, you can new input a chnage to your budget giving it both a name and a value.  You can then add or subtract this value from your budget based on whether your input was a deposit or withdrawal.  Your budget, after each transaction, will then be displayed in the graph.  Note that, you can run this program even while offline.
